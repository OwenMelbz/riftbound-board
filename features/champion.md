A champion is a normal unit card, but that is always accessible without finding it in your main deck.

Your champion MUST match the legend card that you have, e.g. if you have an Annie legend, it can only contain Annie units.

If your deck contains multiple champions it should stack all the champions into the champion pile.

You can right click on the pile of battlegrounds and click "Next Champion" to go to the next, you can cycle through them as many times as you like, or you can hover and over it and push S to switch to the next card, it should loop.

Once the user has found the champion they want, they can right click and hit "Lock champion", this will move all the other champions back randomly into their main deck.

Once locked in, you can "Play" by right clicking on it, and hitting Play. Your champion which moves it from your champion slot into your base (exhausted - so it should be faded to a low opacity like exhausted runes), if killed it will go into the normal trash.
