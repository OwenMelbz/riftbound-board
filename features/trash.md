the trash (discard pile) is a pile of used cards, it has a few bits of functionality.

- recycling
- return

recycling takes all the cards from the discard/trash pile and places them at the BOTTOM of the main deck so that they will re-enter rotation, you can do this by right clicking on it and hitting Recycle, or hovering over it and clickign R on the keyboard, if they hit R on the keyboard it should offer a confirm prompt to say do you want to recycle it?

returning, you can return a specific from the trash back to your hand, to do this you should click the trash pile, it will open a bottom draw with a grid of cards in a scrollable view that have been discarded, as you hover over each card it will highlight a "Pick up" button, which when clicked will return that card to your hand and remove from the trash.
