each person gets 1 legend, this defines which champions they can play.

A legend will stay at in the legend slot all game, however some legends have abilities which exhaust them when used.

Once a legend has been exhausted its opacity should be lowered to show its been used

You can exhaust a rune by hovering over it and pushing E on the keyboard, right clicking and clicking Exhaust, or double clicking on it, once its exhausted it should fade out to like 10% opacity to show its been used.
