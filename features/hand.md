the main deck and hand functionality are semi linked.

When you draw a card from the deck, it goes into your hand face up, it should take from the top of the deck, you can draw it with the D shortcut or by right clicking.

When right clicking theres an extra option of "draw 3" - but no shortcut

the opponent cannot see anything in your hand.

There is an option to shuffle too.

Cards can also be recycled by hovering and pushing R or right clicking and clicking Recycle, but the recycle option should always make the user confirm - check any existing recycle functionality to make sure you can confirm the action.

Cards can also be sent to the trash, by hovering and pushing T, they go face up in the trash

The cards will be sorted alphabetically by card id in your hand, no draggable functionality.

When you hover you can push P to Play which will move it into your base (exhausted), also you can right click and pick Play.

There's another option without a shortcut in the context menu which is "Play Hidden" this flips the card, and moves it to your base face down, when a card is marked as hidden the opponent can never see it, until the user right clicks on the hidden card and clicks "Reveal"

You can also "peak" at the deck, you can choose to peak at 1, or top 2 or 3 - the P keyboard shortcut only peaks at the top card, a right click context menu can provide the other options
